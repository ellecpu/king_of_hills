# king_of_hills
A varient of the classic game of chess
The game starts with the standard chess setup. You'll need to track which player's turn it is, with white always moving first. Pieces move and capture the same way as in standard chess, but there are no checks, checkmates, castling, en passant, or pawn promotion. Players are not informed if their king is in check, and both staying in check or moving into check are legal moves, though they may result in the king being captured and losing the game. The objective is not to checkmate the king but to capture it. You can also win the game by bringing your king to one of the four central squares of the board. That means the game ends when a player’s king is captured and that player loses, or when one player’s king moves to one of the four central squares (d4, e4, d5, and e5) and that player wins. Like in standard chess, pawns can move two spaces forward on their first move, but only one space on subsequent moves.
